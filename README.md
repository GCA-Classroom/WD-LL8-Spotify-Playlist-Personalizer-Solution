# Lab 7: Game Logic for Duolingo

Welcome to your **Dev Shop Challenge**.

Today, you are not completing a coding exercise —  
you are solving a **client problem** using logic.

---

## 🧑🏽‍💼 Client Brief

**Client:** Duolingo

**Problem:**
Duolingo wants to improve beginner engagement by making progress feel more meaningful.

Points exist — but the experience doesn’t *react* to them.

---

## 🎯 Your Goal

Build a prototype that:

- Tracks learner progress (XP, streaks, points, etc.)
- Responds differently based on performance
- Uses randomness to keep things engaging
- Provides feedback that changes over time

---

## ✅ Technical Requirements

Your prototype must include:

- One main progress variable
- One `if / else if / else` chain
- At least two comparison operators
- One array used for randomness

---

## 🧠 Think Like a Developer

Ask yourselves:

- What does success look like for Duolingo?
- When should a user feel rewarded?
- How many learner states exist?
- What logic controls those moments?

Remember:

> Client goals → product behavior → JavaScript logic

---

## 🌱 Stretch Ideas (Optional)

- Add emojis or visual changes
- Add a reset button
- Introduce streak bonuses
- Change feedback wording to match Duolingo’s tone

---

## 🔁 Connection to charity: water

The same logic you build here powers:
- Game mechanics
- Progress tracking
- Win / lose states

You’ll reuse this thinking in your **charity: water game project** — just with a different mission.

You’re not just writing JavaScript.

You’re teaching an app how to think.
